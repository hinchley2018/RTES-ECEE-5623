# peer-review guidelines
| Score | Description |
|------:|-------------|
| 0 | No answer, no work done. |
| 1 | Attempted and some work started, incomplete, does not build, no Makefile (more than 10% done). |
| 2 | Attempted and work outlined, but not started; some parts are unclear; has Makefile, but code does not build or builds with errors and/or runs with errors (more than 25% done). |
| 3 | Attempted, some work completed and remaining outlined, but unclear; Makefile with build warnings; runs to completion, but has errors or fails to complete with expected output and behavior (more than 33% done). |
| 4 | Attempted, more than half of the work done and remaining outlined, but unclear; Makefile has build warnings; runs with no apparent error to completion, but final result is not correct and/or does not complete as expected (more than 50% done). |
| 5 | Attempted, most of the work is done and remaining outlined; lacks some clarity; Makefile has build warnings; runs with no apparent error to completion, but final result is not correct and/or does not complete as expected (more than 66% done). |
| 6 | Somewhat complete work runs to completion; lacks some clarity; Makefile has a few warnings, but overall does not provide expected results (more than 80% done). |
| 7 | Complete work; Makefile has few to no build warnings; results are mostly correct; answers the question with average clarity (code is 100% complete). |
| 8 | Complete and correct with output and behavior as expected; Makefile with no warnings using `-Wall`; runs with no errors or warnings; completes without error and provides credible final results. |
| 9 | Easy to understand, insightful; answers questions completely; performs well with no warnings or errors of any type; provides a correct result that is simple to interpret. |
| 10 | Most complete and correct answer; likely one of the best in the class; could be posted as an exemplar and used to teach other students. |
